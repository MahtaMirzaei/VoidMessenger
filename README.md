# Messenger_Void_13

Hi everyone!
We're Mahta, Borhan and Alireza and this is our first little program we did as our AP's (advanced programing) course final project.

This->program! is able to do stuff such as registering, logining in, creating groups and channels or joining them and sending and recieving messeges within seconds.
We also used lots of creativity in ui forms including applying animations, adding theme change ability ,designing absolutely cute and loveable tool buttons and etc.

Now the server might shut down and it's not on us,
But you may always use the codes for its perfect use of thread, file, connecting to server, the basis of programing a messanger and its design.

Hope you enjoy!
